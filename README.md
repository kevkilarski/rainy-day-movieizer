# Rainy Day Movieizer

This application uses the OpenWeather API and OMDB API to pair a period of rainy weather with a rainy-day movie for the user to enjoy. It renders upcoming periods of rain in three-hour intervals from a user-selected location, and will randomly select a movie to watch during this time.
